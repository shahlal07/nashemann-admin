# Current Status

Last updated: 2026-10-15

**Verified** means supported by direct evidence. **In progress** means actively being worked. **Blocked** requires a documented blocker. **Unknown / not yet audited** means insufficient evidence; it does not mean broken or complete.

## Coordination
- [x] Shared brain structure and read-first workflow committed to this repository.
- [ ] Audit all four repositories and record evidence.
- [ ] Reconcile live issues, branches and PRs into the master tracker.
- [ ] Verify actual app/API/database/auth/deployment relationships.
- [ ] Confirm all owners follow the read-first/update-after-work protocol.
- [x] Draft cross-repository Co-Founder Platform integration plan; issue #15 opened.
- [x] Broader read-only live Supabase discovery confirmed owner membership/decision/approval/audit tables and owner capability/domain helper functions. Earlier targeted name search was incomplete.
- [x] Created initial owner-workspace implementation branch with separate owner login, server-side membership guard, RLS-backed live overview, and Super Admin-only owner provisioning.
- [ ] Run lint, typecheck, build, auth/RLS tests, and preview smoke tests for the implementation branch.
- [ ] Provision and verify the three founder memberships after the branch passes checks; no founder account has been created yet.

## Immediate priorities
1. Audit existing code and open work before rebuilding anything.
2. Resolve P0 security/data-integrity findings with regression tests.
3. Map the customer → vendor → platform-finance order lifecycle.
4. Verify commercial rules before enabling real-money operations.
5. Define owner permissions without changing Super Admin behavior.
6. Replace unknowns with dated findings, evidence and next actions.

## Update format
Date, repo(s), task/issue/PR, finding/change, test evidence, remaining risk, responsible role, next action.
